ORM
ORM WILL CONNECT TO JPA
OBJECT RELATIONAL MAPPING (ORM)

We try to connect object world(classes) and relational world(tables) and map the attributes(columns)
Question arises how will we implement that?
we have different ORM tools: Hibernate, toplink, eclipse link

Another issue comes up when we wamt to change the Hibernate to something else
So is not there another thing that we can do so that we do not need to change
too many code?

That specification is called Java Persistence API (JPA). With this we implement
a common specification so that when we want to swith from Hibernate to toplink for example,
we would not have to change so much of our code

Hibernate implements JPA by the way.

Spring ORM, also is a common specifiation and works well with spring. This also
implements JPA.

BUT if we try to use hibernate and spring orm we will need to write too many code
and that can be simplified with Spring Data JPA.
