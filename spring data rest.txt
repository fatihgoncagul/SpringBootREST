SPRING DATA REST
If we talk about controller - service - repository layers and spring data jpa
jpa does some of the work with us.
For now service layer does not do too much we just redirect the requests from controller to repo
So lets forget the service layer.
Then what if we can remove the controller layer too?
And let something else do the job for us.

It is possible with SPRING DATA REST
it adds url links to our json data and controller functions
it does not change the url for example
if we want to send  delete request to: localhost:8080/jobPosts/10

IF WE WANT TO JUST BUILD RESTFUL WEB-SERVICE AND
IF WE HAVE JPA REPOSITORY LAYER ALREADY
WE SIMPLY USE SPRING DATA REST
